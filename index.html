        <p>The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.</p>
        <p>We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.</p>
        <p>There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of this type of fraction, less than 1 in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.</p>
        <p>If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.</p>
